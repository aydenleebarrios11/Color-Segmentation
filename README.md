# Color Segmentation
During the Fall semester of my junior year I teamed up with 3 of my student peers to work on a Color Segmentation project for my Computer Vision class. This project involved using a set of images to identify an orange in a room in various different positions. For the first section of the project we decided to use a single gaussian and Bayes rule to determine what pixels to classify as orange. As a group we communicated on how we wanted to write each function, and made sure to check each other's work while responding to any questions. Using an initial orange mask, then finding the likelihood and posterior we were able to classify orange pixels in all of the images with solid accuracy. 

The second part of the project involved using Gaussian Mixture Model clustering to classify orange pixels into light orange and dark orange. We then estimated the distance from the camera to the ball by relating it to the area which was the number of orange pixels classified (The bigger the area the closer the camera is to the ball). All in all, I was very proud of how this project turned out. It displays my ability to work with a team, especially in a situation where communication was necessary due to the amount of tweaking and debugging that needed to be done. This project also displays my ability to apply fundamentals of computer vision and algorithms to solve real world problems.
